# Discord-Bot-JavaScript
A simple bot I've made for fun. I won't be updating this a lot since I will be working on other projects after this. I might add music and other things when I have some free time.

This Bot is under MIT.

Discord.js website: discord.js.org

#Top.gg webhook garbage:
Some things to note:

I basically got a thing to forward to my localhost:
https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup

Then the rest is simple. Make sure to set it to json otherwise u cant see the body
